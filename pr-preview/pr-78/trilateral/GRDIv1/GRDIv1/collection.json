  "description": "# Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index \nThe **Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI)**, Version 1 (GRDIv1) dataset  characterizes the relative levels of multidimensional deprivation and poverty in each 30 arc-second (~1 km) pixel, where a **value of 100 represents the highest level of deprivation and a value of 0 the lowest**.\n\n### Creation of GRDIv1:\nGRDIv1 is built from sociodemographic and satellite data inputs that were spatially harmonized, indexed, and weighted into **six main components** (described bellow) to produce the final index raster. Inputs were selected from the best-available data that either continuously vary across space or have at least administrative level 1 (provincial/state) resolution, and which have global spatial coverage. GRDIv1 has six input components, or dimensions, that are combined to determine the degree of relative deprivation:\n\n* **1) The child dependency ratio (CDR):** defined as the ratio between the population of children (ages 0 to 14) to the working-age population (age 15 to 64), where a higher ratio implies a higher dependency on the working population (UN DESA 2006). CDR is intreperted as a dimension where higher dependency ratios are generally associated with younger age structures, implying higher relative deprivation.\n* **2) Infant mortality rates (IMRs):** Is defined as the number of deaths in children under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births in the same year, are a common indicator of population health (Reidpath & Allotey, 2003; Schell et al., 2007). Higher IMRs imply higher deprivation.\n* **3) The Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI):** attempts to assess human well-being through a combination of “three dimensions: education, health, and standard of living (Smits & Permanyer, 2019)”. Lower SHDIs imply higher deprivation.\n* **4) Global rural populations:** are more likely to experience a higher degree of multidimensional poverty when compared to urban populations, other things being equal (Castañeda et al., 2018; Laborde Debucquet & Martin, 2018; Lee & Kind, 2021; UN DESA, 2021; UNDP & OPHI, 2020). Therefore, low values of the ratio of built-up area to non-built up area (BUILT) imply higher deprivation.\n* **5) Intensity of nighttime lights:** are closely associated with anthropogenic activities, economic output, and infrastructure development (Elvidge et al., 2007; Ghosh et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2021; Small et al., 2013). Low values of nighttime lights for the year 2020 (VIIRS Night Lights (**VNL**) 2020) imply higher deprivation.\n* **6) Linear regression from annual VNL data between 2012 and 2020 (VNL slope)**: higher values (increasing brightness) imply decreasing deprivation and lower values (decreasing brightness) imply increasing deprivation.  \n\n### GRDIv1 Citation\nCenter For International Earth Science Information Network-CIESIN-Columbia University.
