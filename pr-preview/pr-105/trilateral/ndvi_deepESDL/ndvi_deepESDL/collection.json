  "description": "c Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Weekly average)**\nNDVI is a key indicator used in remote sensing to measure vegetation health. It works by comparing how plants reflect light in two specific spectral bands: near-infrared (NIR) and red light. The NDVI formula uses the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red reflectance, divided by their sum:\n*\nNDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)*\n\n### Interpreting NDVI\nNDVI values range from -1 to 1. Healthy, dense vegetation reflects more NIR and absorbs more red light, resulting in higher NDVI values, while bare soil, water, or stressed/unhealthy vegetation yield lower NDVI values.\n\n### Additional Information\n* NDVI was calculated using MODIS/Terra + Aqua BRDF/Albedo Nadir Reflectance products, specifically using the red and NIR bands, and aggregated into 8-day means at a 0.25Â° spatial resolution.\n* The data shown is served from the [Earth System Data Lab xcube server](https://viewer.earthsystemdatalab.net/).",
